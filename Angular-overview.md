In Angular applications, NgRx leverages Angular's core concepts of components, modules, and services to manage application states using reactive programming principles. It extends these concepts with the addition of NgRx store, actions, reducers, and effects to facilitate a predictable, state-based architecture.   *(NgRx is a state management library for Angular, inspired by Redux. It leverages RxJS to provide a predictable state container.)*


Components: 
- Components interact with the NgRx store through selectors to read the state and dispatch actions to update the state. 
- Components can subscribe to NgRx selectors (which are just functions that select portions of the state) to react to changes in the data they need.   
- Components use RxJS to manage asynchronous data and events, such as fetching data from an API or handling user input.   


Modules: 
- NgRx modules, like other Angular modules, group-related components, services, and pipes.   
- The NgRx store can be initialized and provided within a module, making it accessible to components within that module's scope.  
- NgRx modules can also include reducers and effects, which are used to update the state and handle side effects respectively.   


Services: 
- NgRx effects can be created as services to handle asynchronous side effects, such as making API calls or interacting with other parts of the application.   
- Services can also be used to dispatch actions to the store, allowing for loose coupling and modularity. 
- Services can leverage RxJS observables to handle asynchronous data and events, which can then be dispatched to the store to update the application's state.   


RxJS: 
- RxJS is used extensively within NgRx to manage the flow of data and events.   
- RxJS Observables are used to represent the state in the NgRx store, allowing components to subscribe to changes.   
- RxJS operators are used to transform and filter data within reducers and effects.  


NgRx Specific Concepts: 
- Store: A central repository for the application state, managed by NgRx.   
- Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to the state.   
- Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.  
- Effects: Services that listen for actions and perform side effects, such as API calls or interacting with other services.  
- Selectors: Functions that select specific parts of the state from the store.
